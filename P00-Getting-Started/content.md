Conquer the universe by baking as many cookies as possible!
In this tutorial we will be creating a Cookie Clicker Clone.

# Getting started
The first thing that we need to do is create a directory for our files.

From your Terminal, navigate to where you'd like to create a new folder and execute the following command:

```
mkdir cookie-clicker-clone
```

Navigate into the directory you just created with the command:

```
cd cookie-clicker-clone
```

# Create your first file

Next, you'll need to create a new file called ```index.html```. This is where our game will live.

You can do this by executing the following commands in your terminal:
```
touch index.html
```

Now all that's left to do is open ```index.html``` inside of your favorite text editor. If you use Atom, you can use the following command from your terminal:

```
atom .
```

And just like that we're all set and ready for some heavy cookie baking action!
