Conquer the universe by baking as many cookies as possible!
In this tutorial we will be creating a Cookie Clicker.

# Making A Plan

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, if it please your Majesty?” he asked.

“Begin at the beginning,” the King said very gravely, “and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”

Just like Alice in Wonderland, in order to avoid endless rabbit holes it's important as software developers that we make a plan before we start coding.

One of the best things to do before starting a project is to write down some **user stories**. A user story is a tool used in *Agile software development* to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The **user story** describes the type of *user*, what they want and *why*. A **user story** helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

When we are ready to begin coding, we develop these users stories one at a time, *from beginning to end*.

Here is are a few user stories for **Make Cookies**:

- As a user, I can click a button to increase the number of cookies I have.
- As a user, I can increase how effective my button clicks are by purchasing upgrades with my cookies.
- As a user, I can purchase Grandmas that increase my number of cookies automatically.
- As a user, I can purchase Cookie Manufacutring Facilities that increase my number of cookies automatically.
- As a user, I can upgrade my grandmas and facilities by purchasing more of them.

As we continue we will discover that we may need more user stories for our game to flourish.

To reiterate, we will develop each of these **user stories** fully before moving onto the next one.

Now that we've made a plan we can get started!

# Getting started

The first thing that we need to do is create a directory for our files.

From your Terminal, navigate to where you'd like to create a new folder and execute the following command:

```
mkdir make-cookies
```

Navigate into the directory you just created with the command:

```
cd make-cookies
```

# Create your first file

Next, you'll need to create a new file called ```index.html```. This is where our game will live.

You can do this by executing the following commands in your terminal:
```
touch index.html
```

Now all that's left to do is open ```index.html``` inside your favorite text editor. If you use Atom, you can use the following command from your terminal:

```
atom .
```

Now that we've created our files, we're ready to open our ovens and get to coding.

# HTML Template

The first thing we're going to do is add in a basic HTML Template.

Inside of index.html, please write the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Make Cookies</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```
Once we have our basic **HTML5 boilerplate** we're ready to start laying out our page.

# Onward

And just like that we're all set and ready for some heavy cookie baking action!
